                Hey there! Thanks so much for visiting this website. It hasn’t always looked like this—
                before diving into web development, I used a Python library called <strong>Streamlit</strong>
                to build and display my projects. I stuck with that framework for a couple of weeks until I
                decided to level up and transition to more robust and flexible tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                That step-up brought me to <strong>Flask</strong>, and this website is the result of that journey.
                In fact, here's what the coding journal looked like when I was still using Streamlit:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/coding_journal_old.webp') }}" 
                 alt="Coding Journal using Streamlit"
                 class="img-fluid rounded shadow"
                 style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        </div>
    </div>
