# Coding Journal using sqlite and streamlit

This program is heavily inspired by mubeen161 Thought Journal (https://github.com/mubeen161/thought_journal)

## Library requirements
Please download these following libraries for the program to work
* streamlit
* datetime
* sqlite3

## Important Notice
Please remember, the program is still small and I know that I haven't done something compelling with this program, but I hope that by doing this. I get to improve my craft of coding as I create more and more projects. There is always a room for improvement and this is certainly one of them - in fact, I am adding this section right now to tell you on some features that I want to add on to this besides that missing "edit" feature
