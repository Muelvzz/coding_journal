# Coding Journal using HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python and SQLite
This program is heavily inspired by mubeen161 Thought Journal (https://github.com/mubeen161/thought_journal)

*Since my last commit was deleted because of my mere stupidity of having no knowledge to deploy this project*

## Important Notice
Please download all the necessary libraries in this program, I cannot send the requirements in the text file and I extremely apologize.

## Stack
    HTML/CSS - frontend styling.
    Javascript - frontend functionality.
    Python - backend.
    SQLite - database.

## Features
    Basic authentication, user login, signup and logout.
    The program han have multiple user/emails.
    User can create and delete journal posts
    When clicking on the username, it will display a user page where you can see all of the journal entry of that user.

## Areas for Iprovement
    Frontend page - could do a little bit of improvement when it comes to the interface and navigation bar.
    Backend - I use flask for this but I hope that I will get to use more robust and large frameworks like django.
    Database - transition from lite version of sql into MySQL.
    Lack of features - some features missing is the verification page, edit journals, account page, and search filters.

## How this program will look
