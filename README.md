# Coding Journal using HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python and SQLite
This program is heavily inspired by mubeen161 Thought Journal (https://github.com/mubeen161/thought_journal)

*Since my last commit was deleted because of my mere stupidity of having no knowledge to deploy this project*

## Important Notice
Please download all the necessary libraries in the requirements.txt. Also, go to the line 21-23 of the __init__.py, and line 64 of the auth.py and integrate your environments variables. While you're in the auth.py, change the app password on the line 73 to your respective app password of your gmail account.
*server.login(sender_email, "bphe trqd tprv jvbm")*

## Stack
    HTML/CSS - frontend styling.
    Javascript - frontend functionality.
    Python - backend.
    MYSql - database.

## Features
    Basic authentication, user login, signup and logout.
    The program han have multiple user/emails.
    User can create and delete journal posts
    When clicking on the username, it will display a user page where you can see all of the journal entry of that user.

## Areas for Iprovement
    The frontend could do a little bit of improvement especially on designing. I used vanilla html and javascript of this, no React or whatsoever.
    The use of light framework such as flask should also be considered. I aim to transition from using flask into django eventually.
    No Api's used in this

## How this program will look

## What I learned when building this
    I lerned the importance of architecturing/planning the program first before attemoting to code it. Consider various tools and what are some aspects that you will need to take some notice on.
    I learned tools like flask, bootstrap, mysql from this and how other programming languages interact with each other.
